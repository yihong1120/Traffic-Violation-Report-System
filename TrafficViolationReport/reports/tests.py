This file contains test cases for the TrafficViolationReport application. It includes tests for the search functionality provided by the SearchTrafficViolationsView, which ensures that the search feature correctly finds and displays violations based on different search parameters and scenarios. The file sets up a test environment with a mock user and some TrafficViolation instances for testing the search feature. After each test method, it cleans up all temporary test data.
